          My design philosophy stems from a belief in timeless good taste whether it be modern or traditional.  This doesn’t mean it can’t be over the top and magical, it simply means that no matter what we are doing it should be done well and look as good 20 years from now as it does today.  There is a certain level of quality and detail that is important in order to achieve this.  The rooms we do should get better and be more interesting with age rather than feeling dated months after they are completed.
<br><br>
Great design is a collaboration between the designer, the client and all of the artisans and creative people who bring a project to fruition.  It is a collaboration with a client who wants something unique; a client who works with their designer and his or her staff and resources as a team; a client who respects and appreciates what each artisan, no matter how small their contribution, brings to the table, and a client who is open to the creative process and participates; one who wants truly good design.  Designing a home is about the client and my goal is to create a home that is a reflection of their dreams and lifestyle.  
<br><br>
My job as a designer is to understand that client.  To understand their lifestyle and their needs and to then proceed to help them put together a project that is far superior than they could ever do themselves.  It helps to be on the same page, but also to have a sense of humor and a real desire to do something special.  In a world where so much has become ordinary, for great design to succeed it requires patience, a certain amount of money, and, most importantly, a desire to live elegantly and uniquely.    </p>
